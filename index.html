<h2><code>What spurred you to join this Internet Publishing class?</h2>
<blockquote><p><code>My initial interest in web design came from creating things and doing HTML on tumblr, and I wanted to learn how to create web pages without such an easy format to follow. Learning it from scratch seems like it's a lot more useful, and beneficial when it comes to creating websites for things I or someone else may need.</code></blockquote></p>

<h2><code>Why do you think being able to code will come in handy?</h2>
<p><blockquote><code>In all honesty, I think coding is one of the most useful things we could be learning at this time. It's used in so many different instances, and is the key to web design. If a designer isn't sure when it comes to their HTML skills, it will be extremely difficult for them to create an adequate website.</code></blockquote></p>

<h2><code>What is your future career path?</code></h2>
<p><blockquote><code>While I'm not necessarily looking into a career in web design, I know it will still be helpful in my future endeavors. Having a lot of useful attributes, knowing how to code and use HTML as well as CSS will make it easier for me to design web pages for my future career, which is journalism. I intend on becoming an investigative journalist, and I'm sure that by the time I manage to pull that off, a lot of things will be web-centric.</code></blockquote></p>
