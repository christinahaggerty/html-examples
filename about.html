<h2><code>What is your future career path?</code></h2>
<p><blockquote><code>While I'm not necessarily looking into a career in web design, I know it will still be helpful in my future endeavors. Having a lot of useful attributes, knowing how to code and use HTML as well as CSS will make it easier for me to design web pages for my future career, which is journalism. I intend on becoming an investigative journalist, and I'm sure that by the time I manage to pull that off, a lot of things will be web-centric.</code></blockquote></p>
